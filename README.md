# Stranger Chats

This is a Firebase Firestore chat app I made for my [iOS Developer Portfolio](https://viktormauzer.github.io). You can add people to your list via their email address and chat. 

The app is made using UIKit and all the views are created and positioned programmatically. The only storyboard in the project is the LaunchScreen.

## Installation

 - Clone this repository and open in Xcode
 - Change the bundle identifier to your unique identifier
 - Create a new project in your Firebase console
 - Download your unique GoogleService-Info.plist file and drag into the Xcode project
 - Open your Firebase console and enable Authentication by email/password
 - Go to the Firebase Firestore section in your Firebase console and create an empty database
 - Make sure to add security rules to your database as you see fit 
 - Run the project in a simulator or on device and enjoy the app (no need to install Firebase SDK, it comes with the app)
